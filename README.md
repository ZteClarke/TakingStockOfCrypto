In this project, I analyzed historical stock price data of three cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum). 

The original dataset came from https://www.finance.yahoo.com. I connected to it through yahoo finance’s API. 

I focused my project on the exploration of historical prices from 2018 to 2022.

The following questions lead my analysis:
    - How have these stocks performed historically? 
    - What is the price of each share? 
    - How volatile is the stock?  
    - What’s the stock’s relationship to the market?
    - What are the best cryptocurrency stocks for each investment strategy?
    - If someone had 1000 dollars to invest in cryptocurrency what are the best stocks to purchase?

This project was completed using Python, Tableau, and PowerPoint.
